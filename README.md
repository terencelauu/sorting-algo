# Basic Sorting Algorithms
Implementing basic sorting algorithms.

1. Radix Sort - A non-comparative integer sorting algorithm, arranges data by examining individual digits.

2. Quicksort - A comparison-based sorting algorithm following the divide-and-conquer approach.
   
3. Heapsort - A comparison-based algorithm, uses a binary heap data structure to build a partially ordered tree.
 
4. Tim Sort - A hybrid sorting algorithm blending merge sort and insertion sort.
  
5. Bogosort - A humorously inefficient sorting algorithm generates random permutations of the input array and checks if they are sorted.
